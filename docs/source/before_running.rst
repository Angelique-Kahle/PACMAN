Before Running
================

Before we can run we have set up some stuff:

1) Decide on a "run directory"

All runs will be saved in a run directory. For the analysis of the GJ1214 data I have the following directory setup:

- user
-- Desktop
--- Projects
---- Observations
----- Hubble
------ GJ1214_13021

In this case `GJ1214_13021` is my run directory

- Copy the contents of run_files into your run directory

The contents of run_files are three different files:

 - **run_pacman.py**

 - **fit_par.txt**

 - **obs_par.pcf**

These three files are part of the package but can also be downloaded under this link: `Download here <https://downgit.github.io/#/home?url=https://github.com/sebastian-zieba/PACMAN/tree/master/pacman/run_files>`_.
