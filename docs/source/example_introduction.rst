Introduction
========================

Let's apply PACMAN on real observations of GJ 1214. The planet GJ 1214 b was observed in `HST Program GO 13021  <https://archive.stsci.edu/proposal_search.php?mission=hst&id=13021>`_ in 15 visits.
We are going to analyse just three visits taken in the middle of the program for simplicity.
