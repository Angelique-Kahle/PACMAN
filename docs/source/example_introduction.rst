Introduction
========================

Let's apply ``PACMAN`` to real observations of GJ 1214. 15 transits of the planet GJ 1214 b were observed in `HST Program GO 13021  <https://archive.stsci.edu/proposal_search.php?mission=hst&id=13021>`_. In this example, we will reduce and analyze three of these visits to highlight ``PACMAN's`` ability to fit multiple transits simultaneously. 

Observation dates (YYYY-MM-DD): 2013-03-13,  2013-03-15,  2013-03-27

These dates correspond to visits 5,6 and 7.
