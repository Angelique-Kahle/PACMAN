Welcome to PACMAN's documentation!
==================================

**Welcome to the documentation for PACMAN**

PACMAN is a pipeline to reduce and analyse HST data (G102 or G141). 

It takes 'ima' dataproducts created by STSci and outputs as a product a light curve. The user has then the possablility to fit various fuctions (transit, eclipse, visit long quadratic trends, orbital exponential trends, etc ...) to this light curve.

THIS PIPELINE IS STILL UNDER HEAVY DEVELOPEMENT!
