Progress Log
------------------

10.07.20
---------
* building a template reduction pipeline

25.08.20
---------
* Changed format of obs_par into yaml and adapted zero_extract.py to the new file format
* line 2267 of mpfit.py used numpy.rank. This function is depreciated and was replaced with numpy.ndim
* zero_extract.py: Got rid of pyfits
* zero_extract.py: Includes a calculation of visit and orbit number.
* zero_extract.py: Outputs a new file called filelist.txt which contains:
- all _ima.fits file names
- Their respective filter / grism
- #visit
- #orbit

27.08.20
---------
* Changed format of filelist.txt to astropy table
* Outsourced filelist.txt generation to "0.py"
* Updated calculation of norbits and nvisits; looks nice now
* last column of filelist.txt is the time from the first exposure now

15.09.20
---------
* renamed files
- zero_extract.py -> 1.py
- extract.py -> 2.py
* changes in 2.py:
- removed D_nointerpol
- removed cRate
- moved ancil class into ancil.py
- deleted calculation of visit and orbit (already exists in 0.py and therefore in filelist.txt)
- moved skyrmin etc for background calc into obs_par.yaml
* got 2.py to run


TODO
----
renaming steps

write readme with detailed instructions

check if .ima files are already flat corrected

get rid of mpfit!

combine util/geometry.py and util/geometry102.py
obs_par.yaml includes some grism specific parameters like BEAMA_i -> generalize for both grisms

include scan direction in filelist.txt

2.py:
replace newM with M
outsource background calculation (think of better way?)
timekeeping depreciated

convert fit_par.txt into yaml.... but how? directories of directories?

change period and t0 in obs_par.yaml
